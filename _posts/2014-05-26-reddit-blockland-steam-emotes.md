Blockland's official Steam emotes, converted to Reddit emotes for use on /r/Blockland or all of Reddit.

This style uses the f7u12 / mylittlepony emote format: `[](/emotename)`

Note that it will apply to all subreddits starting with "Blockland", including /r/Blockland itself, and emote names are case-sensitive (all lowercase)
