[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](/files/blf-no-formatting.user.styl)

![With the style applied](/img/64168_after.png)

For those that hate fun. Disables emotes (from BLF, garycact.us, and Steam), `[color]`, `[font]`, and `[size]`.

## Changelog:

1.0.4: Added fixes for SMF 2

1.0.3: Added Discord custom emoji filtering

1.0.2: Split transparency into its own option (disabled by default) since it may reveal spoilers

1.0.1: Added homepage URL

1.0.0: Converted to a [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/)-based user style for the [Stylus extension](http://add0n.com/stylus.html).

### Userstyles.org

- Modified steam emote check to more broadly search for images that contain "/economy/emoticon/" in the URL - may break some images as a side effect.
